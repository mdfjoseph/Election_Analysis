## Challenge Summary
 Election-Audit Summary
 
Using the Python programming language to determine the results for the election audit is an awesome tool.  If used properly it helps ensure that voting systems operate accurately and can identify and resolve discrepancies in the election process. There are also several other formulas and methods that can be used to generate even more data. If we wanted to delve deeper, we could also determine the race, age, and gender of the voters from each county. And, the informaiton can be modified by determing the county with the lowest turnout and candidate with the lowest vote count and percentage.
